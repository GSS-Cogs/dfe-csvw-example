File formats and conventions

Rounding and suppression

National and regional figures have been rounded to the nearest 10.  Local authority figures are unrounded.

The following symbols have been used in the releases:

- ‘c’ to protect confidentiality. Secondary suppression may be required.
- ‘z’ for not applicable
- ‘:’ for not available
- ‘~’ for negligible – also used for a percentage (<0.5%) that would round to 0 but is not zero

For percentages:

- where the numerator or denominator is small then the figure is replaced by ‘c’
- they may not sum to 100% due to rounding
